      "content": "There are multiple artists tracked as 'Nirvana' on Last.fm. Following are six, listed in order of prominence;\n\n1) Nirvana was an American alternative rock band formed in Aberdeen, Washington in 1987. It was founded by lead singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic. Nirvana went through a succession of drummers, the longest-lasting and best-known being Dave Grohl, who joined in 1990. Though the band dissolved in 1994 after the death of Cobain, their music maintains a popular following and continues to influence modern rock and roll culture.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Nirvana established itself as part of the Seattle grunge scene, releasing its first album, Bleach, for the independent record label Sub Pop in 1989. They developed a sound that relied on dynamic contrasts, often between quiet verses and loud, heavy choruses. After signing to major label DGC Records in 1991, Nirvana found unexpected mainstream success with \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", the first single from their landmark second album Nevermind (1991). A cultural phenomenon of the 1990s, the album went on to be certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Nirvana's sudden success popularized alternative rock, and Cobain found himself described as the \"spokesman of a generation\" and Nirvana the \"flagship band\" of Generation X.\n\nFollowing extensive tours and the 1992 compilation album Incesticide and EP Hormoaning, Nirvana released their third studio album, In Utero (1993), to critical acclaim and further chart success. Its abrasive, less mainstream sound challenged the band's audience, and though less successful than Nevermind, it was a commercial success. Nirvana disbanded following the death of Cobain in 1994. Various posthumous releases have been overseen by Novoselic, Grohl, and Cobain's widow Courtney Love. The posthumous live album MTV Unplugged in New York (1994) won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album in 1996.\n\nDuring their three years as a mainstream act, Nirvana was awarded an American Music Award, Brit Award, Grammy Award, seven MTV Video Music Awards and two NME Awards. They have sold over 25 million records in the United States and over 75 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling bands of all time. Nirvana has also been ranked as one of the greatest music artists of all time, with Rolling Stone ranking them at number 27 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time in 2004, and at number 30 on their updated list in 2011. Nirvana was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in their first year of eligibility in 2014. \n\n Nirvana is one of the best-selling bands of all time, having sold over 75 million records worldwide. With over 25 million RIAA-certified units, the band is also the 80th-best-selling music artist in the United States.[4] Two of the band's studio albums and two of their live albums have reached the top spot on the Billboard 200. Nirvana has been awarded one Diamond, three Multi-Platinum, seven Platinum and two Gold certified albums in the United States by the RIAA, and four Multi-Platinum, four Platinum, two Gold and one Silver certified albums in the UK by the BPI. Nevermind, the band's most successful album, has sold over 30 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums ever. Their most successful song, \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", is among the best-selling singles of all time, having sold 8 million copies.\n\nStephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that prior to Nirvana, \"alternative music was consigned to specialty sections of record stores, and major labels considered it to be, at the very most, a tax write-off\". Following the release of Nevermind, \"nothing was ever quite the same, for better and for worse\". The success of Nevermind not only popularized grunge, but also established \"the cultural and commercial viability of alternative rock in general\". While other alternative bands had hits before, Nirvana \"broke down the doors forever\", according to Erlewine. Erlewine further stated that Nirvana's breakthrough \"didn't eliminate the underground\", but rather \"just gave it more exposure\". In 1992, Jon Pareles of The New York Times reported that Nirvana's breakthrough had made others in the alternative scene impatient for achieving similar success, noting, \"Suddenly, all bets are off. No one has the inside track on which of dozens, perhaps hundreds, of ornery, obstreperous, unkempt bands might next appeal to the mall-walking millions\". Record company executives offered large advances and record deals to bands, and previous strategies of building audiences for alternative rock groups had been replaced by the opportunity to achieve mainstream popularity quickly.\n\nErlewine stated that Nirvana's breakthrough \"popularized so-called 'Generation X' and 'slacker' culture\". Immediately following Cobain's death, numerous headlines referred to Nirvana's frontman as \"the voice of a generation\", although he had rejected such labeling during his lifetime. Reflecting on Cobain's death over ten years later, MSNBC's Eric Olsen wrote, \"In the intervening decade, Cobain, a small, frail but handsome man in life, has become an abstract Generation X icon, viewed by many as the 'last real rock star' [...] a messiah and martyr whose every utterance has been plundered and parsed\".\n\n—————\n\n2) Nirvana is a U.K.-based progressive rock band formed in 1967, primarily active in the late 1960s to early 1970s and still sporadically active to the present day.\n\nThe band was formed in the summer of 1967 in an era when melodic pop/rock music with baroque and chamber arrangements and instrumentation was highly-prized. The band consisted of two songwriter/performers — Greek-born Alex Spyropoulos and Irish-born Patrick Campbell-Lyons — who met in London. They produced a number of singles (notably “Rainbow Chaser”, “Pentecost Hotel”, and “Tiny Goddess”) for the fledgling Island Records label.\n\nThe band was signed by Island Records’ founder Chris Blackwell in the era when he also signed the bands Traffic and Free. \n\nIn October 1967 the band released its first album — a concept album produced by Blackwell titled The Story of Simon Simopath. The album was probably the first narrative concept album ever released, predating story-driven concept albums such as The Pretty Things’ S.F. Sorrow (December 1968), The Who’s Tommy (April 1969), and The Kinks’ Arthur (September 1969).\n\nMusically, the group blended myriad musical styles including rock, pop, folk, jazz, Latin rhythms, and classical music — primarily augmented by baroque chamber-style arrangements.\n\nIn 1968 their follow-up album, All of Us, featured a similar broad range of musical styles. Their third album To Markos III was released on the Pye label in 1969.\n\nIn 1971 the duo amicably separated for a while, with Campbell-Lyons the primary contributor to the next two Nirvana albums, Local Anaesthetic (1971), and Songs of Love and Praise (1972). Campbell-Lyons subsequently worked as a solo artist and issued further albums: Me and My Friend (1973), Electric Plough (1981), and The Hero I Might Have Been (1983) though these did not enjoy commercial success.\n\nThe band reunited in 1985, successfully touring Europe and releasing a compilation album Black Flower (1987) containing some new material. (Black Flower had been the provisional title of their third album.) In the 1990s two further albums were released. Secret Theatre (1994) compiled rare tracks and demos, while Orange And Blue (1996) contained previously unreleased material including a tongue-in-cheek cover of the song “Lithium” originally recorded by the American grunge band Nirvana who released its first album in 1989, and who the band had successfully sued over use of the name Nirvana. The undisclosed terms of the settlement has apparently allowed the original Nirvana to continue using its name and issuing new recordings.\n\nIn 1999 the band released a three-disc CD anthology titled Chemistry including several previously-unreleased tracks and some new material.\n\nTop musicians who played on Nirvana sessions include: Lesley Duncan, Herbie Flowers, Billy Bremner (later of Rockpile/Dave Edmunds fame), Luther Grosvenor, Wynder K. Frogg, Clem Cattini, and the full lineup of rock band Spooky Tooth.\n\nThe group was in the school of baroque-flavored, melodic pop-rock music typified by The Beatles’ Rubber Soul and Revolver, The Beach Boys’ Pet Sounds, The Zombies of Odessey and Oracle, the Procol Harum’s of A Whiter Shade Of Pale, The Moody Blues Days of Future Passed, and The Kinks’ of Something Else by The Kinks. The majority of the tracks on Nirvana’s albums fall into that broad genre of contemporary popular music not easily categorized but perhaps best described as the baroque or chamber strand of progressive rock.\n\nTheir first three albums were reissued on CD by Universal in 2003 and received critical acclaim. In 2005 Universal (Japan) reissued Local Anaesthetic and Songs of Love and Praise.\n\nAs of late 2005 the founding members Alex Spyropoulos and Patrick Campbell-Lyons are still sporadically writing and recording.\n\n—————\n\n3) Nirvana was a short-lived Finnish punk band formed in 1980, whose sole release was a 7\" vinyl disc with tracks “Kielletyt leikit” and “Kuljen kaupungilla” with two hundred pressings.\n\n—————\n\n4) Nirvana was a Dutch pop group, formed in 1985 by producers Bernard Oattes and Rob van Schaik. The group consisted of Anthony Moendir, Frits Broekrits, and Annie Alberti and released one single, “Say When”, which became a big hit. The group split up in 1987.\n\n—————\n\n5) Nirvana is a side project of The Skaters’ James Ferraro. Primitive droning drum beats and swirling synthesizers.\n\n—————\n\n6) Nirvana was a Slovenian hard-rock band in the early seventies. They appear on several collections (YU Record Collector Dream, Boom Festival 72). <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
